# Store API

The Store API provides public endpoints for building storefronts and customer-facing applications.

## Base URL

```
https://api.switchyard.run
```

## Authentication

Most Store API endpoints are public and don't require authentication. For customer-specific operations (like cart management), you can use:

- **Publishable API Key**: For scoping requests to specific sales channels
- **Customer Session**: For authenticated customer operations

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL (Public)
curl 'https://api.switchyard.run/store/products'
```

```bash cURL (With Publishable Key)
curl 'https://api.switchyard.run/store/products' \
  -H 'x-publishable-api-key: YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY'
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://api.switchyard.run/store/products', {
  headers: {
    'x-publishable-api-key': publishableKey
  }
});
```

</CodeGroup>
