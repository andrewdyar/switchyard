# Admin API

The Admin API provides full access to manage your Switchyard store, including products, orders, inventory, customers, and more.

## Base URL

```
https://api.switchyard.run
```

## Authentication

All Admin API endpoints require authentication. You can authenticate using:

- **Session Cookie**: Automatically included when logged into the admin dashboard
- **Bearer Token**: Supabase JWT in the Authorization header

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl 'https://api.switchyard.run/admin/products' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SUPABASE_JWT'
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://api.switchyard.run/admin/products', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`
  }
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## Permissions

Admin API endpoints require specific permissions based on the RBAC system. See the [RBAC documentation](/authentication/rbac) for details on roles and permissions.

Common permission requirements:

| Resource | Read | Write | Delete |
|----------|------|-------|--------|
| Products | `products.read` | `products.write` | `products.delete` |
| Orders | `orders.read` | `orders.write` | `orders.delete` |
| Inventory | `inventory.read` | `inventory.write` | `inventory.scan` |
| Customers | `customers.read` | `customers.write` | `customers.delete` |

## Response Format

All responses are JSON with consistent structure:

```json Success Response
{
  "products": [...],
  "count": 100,
  "offset": 0,
  "limit": 20
}
```

```json Error Response
{
  "type": "invalid_data",
  "message": "Invalid request body"
}
```
