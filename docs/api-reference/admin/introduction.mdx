# Admin API

The Admin API provides full access to manage your Switchyard store, including products, orders, inventory, customers, and more.

## Base URL

```
https://api.switchyard.run
```

## Authentication

All Admin API endpoints require authentication. You can authenticate using:

- **Session Cookie**: Automatically included when logged into the admin dashboard
- **Bearer Token**: Supabase JWT in the Authorization header

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl 'https://api.switchyard.run/admin/products' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SUPABASE_JWT'
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://api.switchyard.run/admin/products', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`
  }
});
```

</CodeGroup>
