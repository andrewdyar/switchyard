# Quickstart

This guide will help you make your first API call to Switchyard.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the Switchyard admin dashboard
- A user account with appropriate permissions
- Your Supabase project credentials (for direct API access)

## Authentication

Switchyard uses Supabase Auth for authentication. There are two main ways to authenticate:

### Option 1: Session-based (Admin UI)

When logged into the admin dashboard, your session cookie is automatically included with requests.

### Option 2: Bearer Token (API/Mobile)

For programmatic access, authenticate with Supabase and use the JWT:

```bash
# 1. Get a token from Supabase
curl -X POST 'https://your-project.supabase.co/auth/v1/token?grant_type=password' \
  -H "apikey: YOUR_ANON_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "user@example.com", "password": "password"}'

# 2. Use the access_token in API calls
curl 'https://api.switchyard.run/admin/products' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

## Your First API Call

Let's fetch the list of products:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl 'https://api.switchyard.run/admin/products?limit=10' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://api.switchyard.run/admin/products?limit=10', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`
  }
});
const { products } = await response.json();
console.log(products);
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    'https://api.switchyard.run/admin/products',
    params={'limit': 10},
    headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {access_token}'}
)
products = response.json()['products']
```

</CodeGroup>
