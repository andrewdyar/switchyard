# Placing Orders

This guide covers how orders are created and managed in Switchyard, including manual order creation for testing.

## Order Sources

Orders can enter Switchyard from multiple sources:

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Goods Mobile App** | Primary source - customers place orders via API |
| **Test Orders** | Manual creation for testing fulfillment flow |
| **Draft Orders** | Admin-created orders via Switchyard dashboard |

## Creating Test Orders

For testing the fulfillment flow without using the mobile app, you can create test orders directly from the Admin API.

### Via API

```bash
POST /admin/test-orders
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "items": [
    {
      "variant_id": "variant_01ABC123",
      "quantity": 2
    },
    {
      "variant_id": "variant_02XYZ456",
      "quantity": 1
    }
  ],
  "shipping_address": {
    "first_name": "Test",
    "last_name": "Customer",
    "address_1": "123 Test Street",
    "city": "Austin",
    "postal_code": "78701"
  },
  "notes": "Testing sweep fulfillment"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Test order created successfully",
  "order": {
    "id": "order_01ABC123",
    "display_id": 1234,
    "status": "pending",
    "items": [
      {
        "id": "item_01",
        "title": "Organic Bananas",
        "quantity": 2,
        "variant_sku": "BAN-ORG-1LB"
      }
    ],
    "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Request Parameters

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `items` | array | Yes | Array of items to include |
| `items[].variant_id` | string | Yes | Product variant ID |
| `items[].quantity` | number | Yes | Quantity to order |
| `customer_id` | string | No | Existing customer ID (creates test customer if omitted) |
| `shipping_address` | object | No | Delivery address (uses default if omitted) |
| `notes` | string | No | Internal notes about the test |

### Listing Test Orders

```bash
GET /admin/test-orders?limit=20&offset=0
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
```

Returns only orders marked as test orders.

## Using Draft Orders

Switchyard's built-in draft order system provides a full-featured way to create orders:

1. Go to **Orders** → **Draft Orders** in the admin dashboard
2. Click **Create Draft Order**
3. Add customer, items, and shipping details
4. Complete the draft to create the order

Draft orders go through the complete order flow and are useful for testing end-to-end.

## Order Flow After Creation

Once an order is created (from any source), it follows the standard fulfillment flow:

1. **Pending** - Order received, awaiting processing
2. **Processing** - System analyzing sourcing (RFC vs sweep)
3. **Sweep/Picking** - Items being sourced
4. **Staged** - Order assembled in tote
5. **Delivering** - Robot en route
6. **Delivered** - Complete

See [Order Flow](/architecture/order-flow) for detailed documentation.

## Testing Scenarios

Common scenarios to test:

### RFC-Only Order

Create an order with items that are in RFC stock:

```json
{
  "items": [
    { "variant_id": "rfc_stocked_item", "quantity": 1 }
  ],
  "notes": "Testing RFC-only fulfillment"
}
```

### Sweep Order

Create an order with items that require retailer sourcing:

```json
{
  "items": [
    { "variant_id": "sweep_only_item", "quantity": 1 }
  ],
  "notes": "Testing sweep fulfillment"
}
```

### Hybrid Order

Create an order with both RFC and sweep items:

```json
{
  "items": [
    { "variant_id": "rfc_item", "quantity": 1 },
    { "variant_id": "sweep_item", "quantity": 1 }
  ],
  "notes": "Testing hybrid fulfillment"
}
```

## Cleanup

Test orders are marked with `is_test_order: true` in metadata and can be filtered/deleted separately from production orders.
