# MCP Server Installation

Switchyard documentation includes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables AI-powered assistance directly in your IDE. This allows Claude, Cursor, and other AI tools to access Switchyard documentation context when helping you code.

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standard for connecting AI assistants to external data sources. With the Switchyard MCP server, your AI coding assistant can:

- Answer questions about Switchyard APIs
- Provide context-aware code suggestions
- Help debug issues with relevant documentation
- Explain order flows, authentication, and architecture

## Installation

### Cursor IDE

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Cursor Settings">
    Go to **Cursor Settings** → **Features** → **MCP Servers**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add MCP Server">
    Click **Add MCP Server** and enter the following URL:
    
    ```
    https://docs.switchyard.run/mcp
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Connection">
    The server should show as connected. You can now ask Claude questions about Switchyard in your Cursor chat.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### VS Code

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install MCP Extension">
    Install an MCP-compatible extension from the VS Code marketplace
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Server">
    Add the Switchyard MCP server URL to your extension settings:
    
    ```json
    {
      "mcp.servers": [
        {
          "name": "Switchyard Docs",
          "url": "https://docs.switchyard.run/mcp"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart VS Code">
    Restart your IDE to activate the connection
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage Examples

Once connected, you can ask your AI assistant questions like:

### API Questions

> "How do I authenticate with the Switchyard Scanner API?"

> "What endpoints are available for inventory management?"

### Architecture Questions

> "Explain the order flow in Switchyard"

> "What's the difference between sweeps and picking?"

### Code Generation

> "Write a function to look up a product by barcode using the Scanner API"

> "Create a TypeScript client for the Switchyard Admin API"

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Failed

If the MCP server fails to connect:

1. Verify you have internet access
2. Check that `https://docs.switchyard.run` is accessible
3. Restart your IDE
4. Try removing and re-adding the server

### Outdated Context

The MCP server automatically syncs with the latest documentation. If you're getting outdated information:

1. Disconnect and reconnect the MCP server
2. Clear your IDE's MCP cache if available
3. Check if there are recent documentation updates

## Security

The MCP server provides read-only access to public Switchyard documentation. No authentication credentials or sensitive data are transmitted through MCP.
