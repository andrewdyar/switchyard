# deletePromotionRulesWorkflow - Switchyard Core Workflows Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `deletePromotionRulesWorkflow`. It belongs to the `@switchyard/medusa/core-flows` package.

This workflow deletes one or more promotion rules. It's used by other workflows,
such as [batchPromotionRulesWorkflow](../core_flows.Promotion.Workflows_Promotion.batchPromotionRulesWorkflow/page.mdx) that manages the rules of a promotion.

You can use this workflow within your own customizations or custom workflows, allowing you to
delete promotion rules within your custom flows.
