This recipe provides the general steps to create an ecommerce store with Switchyard.

## Overview

Businesses use ecommerce stores to:

- Provide an online catalog for customers.
- Accept customer orders and payment.
- Manage their store's data and logistics.

Switchyard provides all essential commerce features out-of-the-box. Businesses can go live and start selling without making any adjustments.

Businesses can also power-up their store by integrating third-party services for payments, fulfillment, and more.

## Install Ecommerce Store Powered by Switchyard

You can use the following command to install an ecommerce store with Switchyard:

```bash
npx create-switchyard-app@latest --with-nextjs-starter
```

This installs:

- The Switchyard application, which is composed of a Node.js server and a Switchyard Admin dashboard. The dashboard opens right after the installation finishes, where you can create a user and start managing your store's data.
- A [Next.js Starter Storefront](../../nextjs-starter/page.mdx) that connects to your Switchyard application to provide customers with ecommerce features.

## Integrate Third-Party Services

You can integrate third-party services and tools, customizing the architecture and commerce features of your store.

For example, you can integrate [Stripe](../../commerce-modules/payment/payment-provider/stripe/page.mdx) to accept payments, or [SendGrid](../../infrastructure-modules/notification/sendgrid/page.mdx) to send emails to customers.

## Deploy the Switchyard Application

The most efficient way to deploy your Switchyard application is to use [Cloud](!cloud!). Cloud is our managed services offering that makes deploying and operating Switchyard applications possible without having to worry about configuring, scaling, and maintaining infrastructure. Cloud hosts your server, Admin dashboard, database, and Redis instance.

With Cloud, you maintain full customization control as you deploy your own modules and customizations directly from GitHub:

- Push to deploy.
- Multiple testing environments.
- Preview environments for new PRs.
- Test on production-like data.

Our documentation also provides a step-by-step guides to deploy your Switchyard application and the Next.js Starter Storefront.
