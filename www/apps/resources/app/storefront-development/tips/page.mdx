In this document, you’ll find tips useful when building a storefront.

## Connect to the Switchyard Application

To send requests from the storefront to the Switchyard application’s Store API Routes, you have two options:

- **For JavaScript frameworks**: use Switchyard’s [JS SDK](../../js-sdk/page.mdx) in any JavaScript framework. This NPM package facilitates interacting with the backend’s REST APIs. All Storefront Development guides use the JS SDK.
- **For other frontend technologies**: interact directly with the Switchyard application by sending requests to its [Store REST APIs](https://docs.switchyard.com/api/store).

---

## Install Types Package

The `@switchyard/types` package provide API routes' request and response types.

If you're not using the JS SDK but are building your application with TypeScript, install `@switchyard/types` to use the correct request and response types:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @switchyard/types@latest
```

## Configure CORS

The Switchyard application’s API routes are guarded by a CORS middleware. Make sure to set the `storeCors` property of the `http` configuration in `switchyard.config.ts` to the storefront’s URL.

For example:

```ts title="switchyard.config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    http: {
      storeCors: "http://localhost:3000",
      // ...
    },
  },
  // ...
})
```
