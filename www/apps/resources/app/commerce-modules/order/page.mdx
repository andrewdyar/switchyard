# {metadata.title}

In this section of the documentation, you will find resources to learn more about the Order Module and how to use it in your application.

<Note title="Looking for no-code docs?">

Refer to the [Switchyard Admin User Guide](!user-guide!/orders) to learn how to manage orders using the dashboard.

</Note>

Switchyard has order related features available out-of-the-box through the Order Module. A [module](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/modules) is a standalone package that provides features for a single domain. Each of Switchyard's commerce features are placed in Commerce Modules, such as this Order Module.

<Note>

Learn more about why modules are isolated in [this documentation](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/modules/isolation).

</Note>

## Order Features

- [Order Management](./concepts/page.mdx): Store and manage your orders to retrieve, create, cancel, and perform other operations.
- [Draft Orders](./draft-orders/page.mdx): Allow merchants to create orders on behalf of their customers as draft orders that later are transformed to regular orders.
- [Apply Promotion Adjustments](./promotion-adjustments/page.mdx): Apply promotions or discounts to the order's items and shipping methods by adding adjustment lines that are factored into their subtotals.
- [Apply Tax Lines](./tax-lines/page.mdx): Apply tax lines to an order's line items and shipping methods.
- [Returns](./return/page.mdx), [Edits](./edit/page.mdx), [Exchanges](./exchange/page.mdx), and [Claims](./claim/page.mdx): Make [changes](./order-change/page.mdx) to an order to edit, return, or exchange its items, with [version-based control](./order-versioning/page.mdx) over the order's timeline.

## How to Use the Order Module

In your Switchyard application, you build flows around Commerce Modules. A flow is built as a [Workflow](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/workflows), which is a special function composed of a series of steps that guarantees data consistency and reliable roll-back mechanism. 

You can build custom workflows and steps. You can also re-use Switchyard's workflows and steps, which are provided by the `@switchyard/medusa/core-flows` package.

For example:

export const highlights = [
  ["12", "Modules.ORDER", "Resolve the module in a step."]
]

```ts title="src/workflows/create-draft-order.ts" highlights={highlights}
import { 
  createWorkflow, 
  WorkflowResponse,
  createStep,
  StepResponse,
} from "@switchyard/framework/workflows-sdk"
import { Modules } from "@switchyard/framework/utils"

const createDraftOrderStep = createStep(
  "create-order",
  async ({}, { container }) => {
    const orderModuleService = container.resolve(Modules.ORDER)

    const draftOrder = await orderModuleService.createOrders({
      currency_code: "usd",
      items: [
        {
          title: "Shirt",
          quantity: 1,
          unit_price: 3000,
        },
      ],
      shipping_methods: [
        {
          name: "Express shipping",
          amount: 3000,
        },
      ],
      status: "draft",
    })

    return new StepResponse({ draftOrder }, draftOrder.id)
  },
  async (draftOrderId, { container }) => {
    if (!draftOrderId) {
      return
    }
    const orderModuleService = container.resolve(Modules.ORDER)

    await orderModuleService.deleteOrders([draftOrderId])
  }
)

export const createDraftOrderWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "create-draft-order",
  () => {
    const { draftOrder } = createDraftOrderStep()

    return new WorkflowResponse({
      draftOrder,
    })
  }
)
```

You can then execute the workflow in your custom API routes, scheduled jobs, or subscribers:

<CodeTabs group="resource-types">
  <CodeTab label="API Route" value="api-route">
    
```ts title="src/api/workflow/route.ts" highlights={[["11"], ["12"]]} collapsibleLines="1-6" expandButtonLabel="Show Imports"
import type {
  SwitchyardRequest,
  SwitchyardResponse,
} from "@switchyard/framework/http"
import { createDraftOrderWorkflow } from "../../workflows/create-draft-order"

export async function GET(
  req: SwitchyardRequest,
  res: SwitchyardResponse
) {
  const { result } = await createDraftOrderWorkflow(req.scope)
    .run()

  res.send(result)
}
```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="Subscriber" value="subscriber">
    
```ts title="src/subscribers/user-created.ts" highlights={[["11"], ["12"]]} collapsibleLines="1-6" expandButtonLabel="Show Imports"
import {
  type SubscriberConfig,
  type SubscriberArgs,
} from "@switchyard/framework"
import { createDraftOrderWorkflow } from "../workflows/create-draft-order"

export default async function handleUserCreated({
  event: { data },
  container,
}: SubscriberArgs<{ id: string }>) {
  const { result } = await createDraftOrderWorkflow(container)
    .run()

  console.log(result)
}

export const config: SubscriberConfig = {
  event: "user.created",
}
```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="Scheduled Job" value="scheduled-job">
    
```ts title="src/jobs/run-daily.ts" highlights={[["7"], ["8"]]}
import { SwitchyardContainer } from "@switchyard/framework/types"
import { createDraftOrderWorkflow } from "../workflows/create-draft-order"

export default async function myCustomJob(
  container: SwitchyardContainer
) {
  const { result } = await createDraftOrderWorkflow(container)
    .run()

  console.log(result)
}

export const config = {
  name: "run-once-a-day",
  schedule: `0 0 * * *`,
}
```

  </CodeTab>
</CodeTabs>
