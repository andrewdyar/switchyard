# {metadata.title}

Create a standalone build of the Switchyard application that you can deploy to production.

This creates a build that:

- Doesn't rely on the source TypeScript files.
- Can be copied to a production server reliably.

The build is output to a new `.medusa/server` directory.

```bash
npx switchyard build
```

Refer to the [Build Switchyard Application](!docs!/learn/build) guide for next steps.

      Whether to build only the admin to host it separately. If this option is not passed, the admin is built to the `.medusa/server/public/admin` directory. When this option is passed, the admin is built to the `.medusa/admin` directory instead.

## Build Switchyard Admin

By default, the Switchyard Admin is built to the `.medusa/server/public/admin` directory.

If you want a separate build to host the admin as a standalone application, such as on Vercel, pass the `--admin-only` option as explained in the [Options](#options) section. This outputs the admin to the `.medusa/admin` directory instead.
