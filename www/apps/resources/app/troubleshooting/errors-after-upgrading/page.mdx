If you run into errors after updating your Switchyard application, it's highly recommended to check the [GitHub Release Notes](https://github.com/switchyard/medusa/releases) for any upgrade guides related to the version you upgraded to. These release notes may include details on breaking changes and how to resolve them before upgrading.

Also, after updating your Switchyard application, make sure that you ran the `db:migrate` command in the root directory of your Switchyard application:

```bash
npx switchyard db:migrate
```

This ensures your application has the latest database structure required. Then, try running your Switchyard application again and check whether the same error occurs.
