This error typically occurs when you set up a Switchyard project with `create-switchyard-app` and try to run the Switchyard application.

To resolve this issue, make sure you change into the application's directory of the Switchyard project you created before trying to start the Switchyard application:

```bash npm2yarn
cd my-medusa-store
npm run dev
```
