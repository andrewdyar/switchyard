When connecting your Switchyard application to a PostgreSQL Docker container, make sure the `5432` port is exposed.

To do that, either pass the `-p` option to the `docker run` command. For example:

```bash
docker run -d -p 5432:5432 --name some-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=supersecret postgres
```

Or, if you're using Docker Desktop, you can provide the option under the container's "Optional settings" collapsable.

If you expose the PostgreSQL docker container at a port other than `5432`, make sure to include it in your database URL.

When installing Switchyard with `create-switchyard-app`, you can provide a database URL with the different port using the `--db-url` option.

For example:

```bash
npx create-switchyard-app@latest --db-url "postgres://user:password@localhost:<YOUR_PORT>/medusa-store"
```

Where `<YOUR_PORT>` is the exposed port if it's different than `5432`.

Refer to the [databaseUrl configuration documentation](!docs!/learn/configurations/switchyard.config#databaseUrl) to learn how to set the database URL for an installed Switchyard application.
