If you see the following error in the Switchyard Admin's console:

```bash
Blocked request. This host (X) is not allowed. To allow this host, add X to server.allowedHosts in vite.config.js.
```

Where `X` is the host that's being blocked. For example, `example.com`.

## Why this Error Occurred

This error occurs if you deploy Switchyard but are using development mode (`NODE_ENV=development`). This can happen accidentally or unintentionally, but Switchyard defaults `NODE_ENV` to `production`.

## How to Fix it

### Option 1: Use Production Mode

To resolve this error, ensure that you're running Switchyard in production mode. You can set the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to `production` when starting Switchyard:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Option 2: Allow the Host

If you intentionally want to use development mode in your deployed Switchyard instance, you can allow the host that's being blocked using the `admin.vite` configuration in `switchyard.config.ts`.

For example:

```ts title="switchyard.config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  // ...
  admin: {
    vite: () => {
      return {
        server: {
          allowedHosts: [".example.com"],
        },
      }
    },
  },
})
```

In the above example, you allow the host `example.com` to access the Switchyard Admin. Make sure that when you replace `example.com` with your actual host, you include the leading `.` before the domain name.
