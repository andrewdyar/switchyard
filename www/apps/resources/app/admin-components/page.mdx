In this section of the documentation, you'll learn how to implement common Switchyard Admin components and layouts.

These guides are useful to build components and layouts that follow the same design conventions as the Switchyard Admin. The components and layouts are built on top of the [Switchyard UI package](!ui!).

<Note title="Tip">

Refer to the [Switchyard UI documentation](!ui!) for a full list of components.

</Note>

## Layouts

These layout components allow you to set the layout of your [UI routes](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/admin/ui-routes) similar to the layouts used in the Switchyard Admin.
