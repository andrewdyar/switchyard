## What is the Switchyard Admin?

The Switchyard Admin is an intuitive dashboard that allows merchants to manage their ecommerce store. It provides management features related to products, orders, customers, and more.

The Switchyard Admin is built with [Vite v5](https://v5.vite.dev/). When you [install the Switchyard application](../../installation/page.mdx), you also install the Switchyard Admin. Then, when you start the Switchyard application, you can access the Switchyard Admin at `http://localhost:9000/app`.

<Note title="Tip">

If you don't have an admin user, use the [Switchyard CLI](!resources!/switchyard-cli/commands/user) to create one.

## How to Customize the Switchyard Admin?

You can customize the Switchyard Admin dashboard by:

- Adding new sections to existing pages using [Widgets](./widgets/page.mdx).
- Adding new pages using [UI Routes](./ui-routes/page.mdx).

The next chapters will cover these two topics in detail.

### What You Can't Customize in the Switchyard Admin

You can't customize the admin dashboard's layout, design, or the content of the existing pages (aside from injecting widgets). You also can't change the Switchyard logo used in the admin dashboard.

If your use case requires heavy customization of the admin dashboard, you can build a custom admin dashboard using Switchyard's [Admin API routes](!api!/admin).
