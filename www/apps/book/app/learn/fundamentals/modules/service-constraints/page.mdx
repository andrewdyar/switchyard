This chapter lists constraints to keep in mind when creating a service.

## Use Async Methods

Switchyard wraps service method executions to inject useful context or transactions. However, since Switchyard can't detect whether the method is asynchronous, it always executes methods in the wrapper with the `await` keyword.

For example, if you have a synchronous `getMessage` method, and you use it in other resources like workflows, Switchyard executes it as an async method:

```ts
await blogModuleService.getMessage()
```

So, make sure your service's methods are always async to avoid unexpected errors or behavior.

```ts highlights={[["8", "", "Method must be async."], ["13", "async", "Correct way of defining the method."]]}
import { SwitchyardService } from "@switchyard/framework/utils"
import Post from "./models/post"

class BlogModuleService extends SwitchyardService({
  Post,
}){
  // Don't
  getMessage(): string {
    return "Hello, World!"
  }

  // Do
  async getMessage(): Promise<string> {
    return "Hello, World!"
  }
}

export default BlogModuleService
```
