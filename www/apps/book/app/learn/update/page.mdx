## Switchyard Versioning

When Switchyard puts out a new release, all packages are updated to the same version. This ensures that all packages are compatible with each other, and makes it easier for you to switch between versions.

<Note>

This doesn't apply to the design-system packages, including `@switchyard/ui`, `@switchyard/ui-presets`, and `@switchyard/ui-icons`. These packages are versioned independently. However, you don't need to install and manage them separately in your Switchyard application, as they are included in the `@switchyard/admin-sdk`. If you're using them in a standalone project, such as a storefront or custom admin dashboard, refer to [this section in the Switchyard UI documentation](!ui!/installation/standalone-project#updating-ui-packages) for update instructions.

</Note>

Switchyard updates the version number `major.minor.patch` according to the following rules:

- **patch**: A patch release includes bug fixes and minor improvements. It doesn't include breaking changes. For example, if the current version is `2.0.0`, the next patch release will be `2.0.1`.
- **minor**: A minor release includes new features, fixes, improvements, and breaking changes. For example, if the current version is `2.0.0`, the next minor release will be `2.1.0`.
- **major**: A major release includes significant changes to the entire codebase and architecture. For those, the update process will be more elaborate. For example, if the current version is `2.0.0`, the next major release would be `3.0.0`.

## Check Installed Version

To check the currently installed version of Switchyard in your project, run the following command in your Switchyard application:

```bash
npx switchyard -v
```

This will show you the installed version of Switchyard and the [Switchyard CLI tool](!resources!/switchyard-cli), which should be the same.

---

## Check Latest Version

The documentation shows the current version at the top right of the navigation bar. When a new version is released, you'll find a blue dot on the version number. Clicking it will take you to the [release notes on GitHub](https://github.com/switchyard/medusa/releases).

You can also star the [Switchyard repository on GitHub](https://github.com/switchyard/medusa) to receive updates about new releases on your GitHub dashboard. Our team also shares updates on new releases on our social media channels.

## Update Switchyard Application

Before updating a Switchyard application, make sure to check the [release notes](https://github.com/switchyard/medusa/releases) for any breaking changes that require actions from your side.

Then, to update your Switchyard application, bump the version of all `@switchyard/*` dependencies in your `package.json`. Then, re-install dependencies:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install
```

This will update all Switchyard packages to the latest version.

### Running Migrations

Releases may include changes to the database, such as new tables, updates to existing tables, updates after adding links, or data migration scripts.

So, after updating Switchyard, run the following command to migrate the latest changes to your database:

```bash
npx switchyard db:migrate
```

This will run all pending migrations, sync links, and run data migration scripts.

### Reverting an Update

Before reverting an update, if you already ran the migrations, you have to first identify the modules who had migrations. Then, before reverting, run the `db:rollback` command for each of those modules.

For example, if the version you updated to had migrations for the Cart and Product Modules, run the following command:

```bash
npx switchyard db:rollback cart product
```

Then, revert the update by changing the version of all `@switchyard/*` dependencies in your `package.json` to the previous version and re-installing dependencies:

```bash npm2yarn
npm  install
```

Finally, run the migrations to sync link changes:

```bash
npx switchyard db:migrate
```

## Understanding Codebase Changes

In the Switchyard codebase, our team uses the following [TSDoc](https://tsdoc.org/) tags to indicate changes made in the latest version for a specific piece of code:

- `@deprecated`: Indicates that a piece of code is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. The tag's message will include details on what to use instead. However, our updates are always backward-compatible, allowing you to update your codebase at your own pace.
- `@since`: Indicates the version when a piece of code was available from. A piece of code that has this tag will only be available starting from the specified version.

---

## Update Plugin Project

If you have a Switchyard plugin project, you only need to update its `@switchyard/*` dependencies in the `package.json` file to the latest version. Then, re-install dependencies:

```bash npm2yarn
npm  install
```
