In this guide, you'll learn how to use Switchyard UI for building Switchyard Admin customizations.

## Use Switchyard UI in Switchyard Admin

The `@switchyard/ui` and `@switchyard/icons` packages are already installed as dependencies of the `@switchyard/admin-sdk` package in your Switchyard project. They're installed by default in your Switchyard plugins as well.

So, you can import the packages and use them in your Switchyard Admin customizations without any additional installation steps.

For example, to use the UI and icon packages in a UI route:

```tsx title="src/admin/routes/custom/page.tsx"
import { defineRouteConfig } from "@switchyard/admin-sdk"
import { ChatBubbleLeftRight } from "@switchyard/icons"
import { Container, Heading } from "@switchyard/ui"

const CustomPage = () => {
  return (
    <Container className="divide-y p-0">
      <div className="flex items-center justify-between px-6 py-4">
        <Heading level="h2">This is my custom route</Heading>
      </div>
    </Container>
  )
}

export const config = defineRouteConfig({
  label: "Custom Route",
  icon: ChatBubbleLeftRight,
})

export default CustomPage
```

In this example, you use the [Container](../../components/container/page.mdx) and [Heading](../../components/heading/page.mdx) components in the UI route. You also use the `ChatBubbleLeftRight` icon from the [Icons package](../../icons/overview/page.mdx) for the UI route's sidebar item.
