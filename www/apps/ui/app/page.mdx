# {metadata.title}

Welcome to Switchyard UI, a React implementation of the Switchyard design system.

Switchyard UI is a collection of components, hooks, utility functions, icons, and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) classes that can be used to build
a consistent user interface across the Switchyard Admin and client applications.

## Figma Design System

The Switchyard UI design system is also available on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1278648465968635936/medusa-ui). You can explore the components, icons, and design tokens used in Switchyard UI.

This is especially useful if you have the [Figma Dev MCP](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/32132100833559-Guide-to-the-Dev-Mode-MCP-Server) set up, allowing you to easily copy designs from the Figma Switchyard UI file to your projects.

## How Switchyard UI is Built

At its core, Switchyard UI is a styled and slightly opinionated implementation of [Radix Primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives).
Our team has also referenced the fantastic [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for inspiration in certain implementations.

Our team strongly believes in keeping the components simple and
composable, much like Switchyard's foundation. This allows you to build whatever you need.

Our team has tried to avoid overloading
the component API and, instead, has leveraged the native HTML API, which gets implemented
and respected accordingly, and passed to the underlying elements.
