In this guide, you'll learn about the color classes available in Switchyard UI and how to use them.

## Overview

Switchyard UI provides Tailwind CSS classes for colors from the Switchyard design system. These classes can be used to style components and elements consistently across your Switchyard and standalone applications.

To view the colors in the list below in dark mode, switch the documentation's theme from the menu in the top right.

To copy a color's Tailwind CSS class from the list below, click on it.

### How to Use the Switchyard UI Colors

You can use the color classes in your Switchyard Admin customizations or standalone projects that have the `@switchyard/ui` package installed.

You can apply the color classes as CSS classes to any element.

For example, to set the background color of the document's body:

```tsx
<body className="bg-medusa-bg-base">
  ...
</body>
```
