-- Initial Supabase migration
-- This is a placeholder migration to establish the migrations directory
-- Future schema changes should be added as new timestamped migration files

-- Note: Your existing schema is managed by Switchyard/Medusa migrations
-- This Supabase migrations folder is for database-level changes that need
-- to be tracked separately (RLS policies, functions, triggers, etc.)
